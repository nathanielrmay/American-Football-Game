# American Football Game

### A deep, narrative-driven American football simulation.

This repository hosts the development of Football Sim, a text-based sports game where the story is just as important as the stats. The core concept is to use an AI-driven narrative engine to generate dynamic play-by-play, unique athlete personalities, and emergent storylines, creating a truly immersive and endlessly replayable role-playing experience.
