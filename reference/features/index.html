    <h1 id="feature-catalog">Feature Catalog</h1>
<p>This document categorizes features into a MoSCoW matrix to guide development priorities and provides detailed descriptions of key game systems.</p>
<h2 id="moscow-prioritization">MoSCoW Prioritization</h2>
<p>This section uses the MoSCoW method (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) to prioritize features for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and beyond.</p>
<h3 id="must-have-for-mvp">Must Have (for MVP)</h3>
<p>These features are non-negotiable for the first playable version. The game is not functional without them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Simulation Engine</strong>: Ability to simulate a single play, a drive, and a full game, producing text-based logs and box scores.</li>
<li><strong>Data-Driven Characters</strong>: <code>Individual</code> and <code>Player</code> models with attributes that directly influence simulation outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified League Structure</strong>: A single, functional league with a generated schedule and a championship game.</li>
<li><strong>Entity Generation</strong>: Logic to create new players and teams to populate the world, driven by <code>Archetype</code> and <code>Generation_Config</code> models.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Playbook System</strong>: Pre-set plays are used by AI coaches; no user-facing play editor.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Financial Reporting</strong>: Generation of simple team financial reports.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Developer Interface</strong>: A functional, likely command-line, interface to run simulations and browse NPCs.</li>
<li><strong>World &amp; Economy Foundation</strong>: A functioning <code>World</code> model with a cascading economy (<code>Country</code>, <code>State</code>, <code>City</code>) to provide context.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="should-have">Should Have</h3>
<p>Important features that are not essential for the initial MVP but should be prioritized immediately after.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced Playbook System</strong>: A user-facing tool to create and edit detailed plays and formations.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Financial Model</strong>: Team budgets, player salaries, revenue from tickets and marketing, and operational expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Player Progression &amp; Aging</strong>: A system for player attributes to develop and decline over their careers.</li>
<li><strong>Core Off-Season Logic</strong>: Implementation of key off-season phases like player retirement and new player drafts.</li>
<li><strong>LLM-Powered Narrative Engine</strong>: Use of an LLM to generate rich narrative content, including game summaries, player news (awards, injuries), dynamic rivalries, media interactions, and RPG-centric events.</li>
<li><strong>Character Life-Sim</strong>: A system for managing the playable character's personal life, including relationships, health, and stress, with cascading effects on job performance.</li>
<li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</strong>: A full graphical interface for team and league management.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Multiplayer</strong>: A "league hosting" service where multiple users manage teams in the same game world.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Scouting System</strong>: Detailed scouting reports, combine data, and discovery of hidden player potential.</li>
<li><strong>In-depth Staff Roles</strong>: Hiring and managing of coaches, coordinators, and scouts who have their own attributes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="could-have">Could Have</h3>
<p>Desirable features that would improve the game but are not a priority. These can be added in later versions if time permits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Historical Modes</strong>: Ability to start simulations in past eras with historical data.</li>
<li><strong>Generational Play</strong>: Ability to continue the game as the playable character's offspring after death or retirement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wont-have-for-now">Won't Have (For Now)</h3>
<p>Features explicitly excluded to prevent scope creep and maintain focus.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-time 3D Play Visualization</strong>: Gameplay will be presented through text and statistics, not a 3D engine like Madden.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronous Multiplayer</strong>: Multiplayer will not be real-time, head-to-head gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>Official Licensing</strong>: The game will use fictional players, teams, and leagues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feature-descriptions">Feature Descriptions</h2>
<p>This section provides more detailed outlines for major features and game systems.</p>
<h3 id="npc-character-roles">NPC &amp; Character Roles</h3>
<p>The world will be populated by a variety of Non-Player Characters (NPCs), each with their own attributes, personalities, and roles. All NPCs are built on the base <code>Individual</code> model.</p>
<h4 id="team-personnel">Team Personnel</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Players</strong>: The athletes who play in the games. They have detailed physical, mental, and skill-based attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Head Coach</strong>: Manages the coaching staff and has ultimate authority on game-day strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Offensive/Defensive/Special Teams Coordinators</strong>: Specialized coaches responsible for their respective phases of the game. Their schemes and play-calling tendencies influence team performance.</li>
<li><strong>General Manager</strong>: Responsible for player contracts, trades, and drafting. This is a potential role for the playable character.</li>
<li><strong>Team Owner</strong>: The ultimate authority for the team. Sets budgets, long-term goals, and can hire/fire the GM. This is another potential role for the playable character.</li>
<li><strong>Scouts</strong>: Evaluate talent from other leagues and in the upcoming draft class.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Staff</strong>: Manage player injuries and rehabilitation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="external-world-npcs">External World NPCs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agents</strong>: Represent players during contract negotiations.</li>
<li><strong>Media Personnel</strong>: Journalists and reporters who write stories, conduct interviews, and influence public perception.</li>
<li><strong>Family Members</strong>: Spouses, children, and other relatives who are part of the player character's life-sim narrative.</li>
</ul>
