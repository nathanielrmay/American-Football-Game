# American Football Game

### *Where the lives of your players are as important as their stats.*

Imagine a text-based sports simulation where every season unfolds like a captivating novel. Our game uses advanced AI to generate dynamic play-by-play, craft unique athlete personalities that drives locker room drama and media firestorms, and even create vivid images for characters and pivotal game moments. It's not just about stats; it's about building your dynasty through an endlessly evolving, character-driven narrative. I'm not just simulating the sport; I'm simulating the lives of those who live it.

These are the planning documents for a deep American football simulation and role-playing game. Players will manage teams across multiple tiered leagues, focusing on strategic playbook creation, statistical analysis, and narrative-driven interactions. The game uses AI to produce truly unique content that drives immersion, making each playthrough a distinct experience.

This is a hobby project, created for fun and to connect with my nephews and practice my trade of software development and one of my longest standing interests, data and analytics. I will release all of my own code under a FOSS license. The game will likely require a paid LLM API key to run. I cannot provide these, so users will need to supply their own. If the game were to gather the required audience I might offer to host leagues for some small fee.
