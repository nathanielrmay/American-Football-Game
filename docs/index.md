# Football Sim

Imagine a text-based sports simulation where every season unfolds like a captivating novel. Our game uses advanced AI to generate dynamic play-by-play, craft unique athlete personalities that drive locker room drama and media firestorms, and even create vivid images for characters and pivotal game moments. It's not just about stats; it's about building your dynasty through an endlessly evolving, character-driven narrative. We're putting the 'story' back in 'sports story' for a truly immersive experience.

This is the planning document(s) for a deep American football simulation and role-playing game where players manage teams across multiple tiered leagues, focusing on strategic playbook creation, statistical analysis, and narrative-driven player and owner interactions, using AI to produce truly unique content that drive immersion.

This will be strictly, 'for fun' or a 'hobby project', for me to connect with my nephews and practice my trade of software development and one of my longest standing interests, data and analytics. I will release all of my own code in a FOSS way. The game will likely require a paid llm api key of some sort to run, i can not provide those for anyone else, the user will have to supply their own. If the game were to gather the required audience I might offer to host leagues for some small fee.
