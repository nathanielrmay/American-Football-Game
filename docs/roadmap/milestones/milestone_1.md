# Milestone 1: Foundational Scaffolding

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Set up development environment (Python, PHP, Postgres).
- [ ] Create the game database in Postgres.
- [ ] Write and execute a single SQL script to create all tables.
- [ ] Develop a basic test harness/script to connect to the database.
- [ ] Implement and verify CRUD operations for key tables (`world`, `country`, `user`).

---

## 1. Goal

To establish the project's core infrastructure, including the physical database and a basic developer interface for data manipulation and verification.

## 2. Description

This initial phase involves translating the schemas in `plan/10_data_models.md` into a functioning Postgres database and setting up the core project structure. It's about building the physical foundation upon which all other features will be built. A basic interface (likely a command-line tool or test harness) will be created to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing for initial data setup and ensuring the architecture is sound.

## 3. Key Systems & Data Models

- **All Data Models from `plan/10_data_models.md`:** The primary task is to implement the entire defined schema in a single database.
- **Postgres Database:** The server-based database that will store all game data, including user authentication and game world simulation data.
- **Developer Test Harness (Python/PHP):** A simple script to verify database connectivity and schema correctness.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Environment Setup**
    - [ ] Install Python and the `psycopg2` library.
    - [ ] Install PHP and the Postgres driver.
    - [ ] Install and configure a local Postgres server instance.
2.  **Database Creation**
    - [ ] Create the main database and a user role with appropriate permissions in Postgres.
3.  **Schema Implementation**
    - [x] Create a single SQL script (`schema.sql`) containing all `CREATE TABLE` statements from `10_data_models.md`.
    - [ ] Execute `schema.sql` against the Postgres database.
4.  **Verification**
    - [ ] Develop a simple script (e.g., `db_test.py`) that connects to the database.
    - [ ] Implement test functions in the script to perform CRUD operations on the `world` table and the `user` table.
    - [ ] Run the tests to confirm success.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- A Postgres database is created and accessible from the development environment.
- All tables from `plan/10_data_models.md` exist in the database as specified.
- A developer script can successfully connect to the database.
- The script can create, read, update, and delete a record from the `world` table and the `user` table without errors.

## 6. Considerations & Notes

- The primary focus is data integrity. Ensure all foreign key constraints, unique constraints, and default values are implemented correctly as defined in the data model document.
- The developer test harness does not need a user interface; it is purely for backend verification.
