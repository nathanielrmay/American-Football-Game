- **Strategic Control:**
    - **Pre-Game Strategy:** Set situational tendencies via sliders, such as pass/run ratios for specific downs (e.g., 60/40 pass on 1st & 10).
    - **In-Game Adjustments:** Issue broad commands during the game to alter strategy, such as 'Run more on 1st down' or 'Go to 2-minute offense'.
- **Simulation & Reporting:**
    - A full game is simulated with adjustable speed. Every snap is recorded with a text description and updates all relevant player statistics.
    - Full game logs are generated, including a play-by-play log and a complete box score.
